# PythonProjects
My projects created with Python, which I learned on my own. The projects are:

A program that creats a sheet with 100 multiplications, divisions, subtractions or additions to study mathematics with children

A Snake clone, but I changed the movement, because I just like it better that way.

A pong clone.

A YuGioH Lifepoints counter
